msgid "|app| has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. Normally, you just add a book to |app|, click convert and |app| will try hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However, |app| accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are as suitable as others for conversion to ebooks. In the case of such input formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, |app| has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note however that |app|'s conversion system is not a substitute for a full blown ebook editor. To edit ebooks, I recommend first converting them to EPUB or AZW3 using |app| and then using the Edit Book feature to get them into perfect shape. You can then use the edited ebook as input for conversion into other formats in |app|."

The font size key tells |app| how many \"steps\" bigger or smaller a given font size should be compared to the base font size. The idea is that there should be a limited number of font sizes in a document. For example, one size for the body text, a couple of sizes for different levels of headings and a couple of sizes for super/sub scripts and footnotes. The font size key allows |app| to compartmentalize the font sizes in the input documents into separate \"bins\" corresponding to the different logical font sizes."

Both these options are very comprehensive, removing spacing, or inserting it for *all* paragraphs (technically <p> and <div> tags).
