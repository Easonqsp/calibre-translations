"The |app| ebook viewer has the ability to display math embedded in ebooks "
"(ePub and HTML files). You can typeset the math directly with TeX or MathML "
"or AsciiMath. The |app| viewer uses the excellent `MathJax "
"<http://www.mathjax.org>`_ library to do this. This is a brief tutorial on "
"creating ebooks with math in them that work well with the |app| viewer."

"You can write mathematics inline inside a simple HTML file and the |app| "
"viewer will render it into properly typeset mathematics. In the example "
"below, we use TeX notation for mathematics. You will see that you can use "
"normal TeX commands, with the small caveat that ampersands and less than and"
" greater than signs have to be written as &amp; &lt; and &gt; respectively."
