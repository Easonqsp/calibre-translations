msgid "Here, we will show you how to integrate the calibre content server into another server. The most common reason for this is to make use of SSL or more sophisticated authentication. There are two main techniques: Running the calibre content server as a standalone process and using a reverse proxy to connect it with your main server or running the content server in process in your main server with WSGI. The examples below are all for Apache 2.x on linux, but should be easily adaptable to other platforms."

msgid "A reverse proxy is when your normal server accepts incoming requests and passes them onto the calibre server. It then reads the response from the calibre server and forwards it to the client. This means that you can simply run the calibre server as normal without trying to integrate it closely with your main server, and you can take advantage of whatever authentication systems your main server has in place. This is the simplest approach as it allows you to use the binary calibre install with no external dependencies/system integration requirements. Below, is an example of how to achieve this with Apache as your main server, but it will work with any server that supports Reverse Proxies."
