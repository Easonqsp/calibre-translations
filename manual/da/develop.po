"|app| has its roots in the Unix world, which means that its design is highly"
" modular. The modules interact with each other via well defined interfaces. "
"This makes adding new features and fixing bugs in |app| very easy, resulting"
" in a frenetic pace of development. Because of its roots, |app| has a "
"comprehensive command line interface for all its functions, documented in "
":ref:`cli`."

"The modular design of |app| is expressed via ``Plugins``. There is a "
":ref:`tutorial <customize>` on writing |app| plugins. For example, adding "
"support for a new device to |app| typically involves writing less than a 100"
" lines of code in the form of a device driver plugin. You can browse the "
"`built-in drivers "
"<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Ekovid/calibre/trunk/files/head%3A/src/calibre/devices/>`_."
" Similarly, adding support for new conversion formats involves writing "
"input/output format plugins. Another example of the modular design is the "
":ref:`recipe system <news>` for fetching news. For more examples of plugins "
"designed to add features to |app|, see the `plugin index "
"<http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1362767#post1362767>`_."
