If you do a conversion from EPUB to EPUB, the original EPUB file will be saved as ORIGINAL_EPUB. Simply right click on the ORIGINAL_EPUB entry in the Book Details panel and choose :guilabel:`Compare to EPUB format`."

msgid "One useful technique when comparing books is to tell the comparison tool to beautify the text and style files before calculating differences. This can often result in cleaner and easier to follow differences. To do this, click the :guilabel:`Options` button in the bottom right and choose :guilabel:`Beautify files before comparing`. Note that beautifying can sometimes have undesired effects, as it can cause invalid markup to be altered to make it valid. You can also change the number of lines of context shown around differences via the :guilabel:`Options` button."

msgid "The :ref:`edit` tool has a very useful feature, called :ref:`checkpoints`. This allows you to save the current state of the book as a named *checkpoint*, to which you can revert if you do not like the changes you have made since creating the checkpoint. Checkpoints are also created automatically when you perform various automated actions in the editor. You can see the list of checkpoints by going to :guilabel:`View->Checkpoints` and then use the :guilabel:`Compare` button to compare the book at the selected checkpoint with the current state. The comparison tool will show the checkpoint on the left and the current state on the right."
