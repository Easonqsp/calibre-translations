"calibre has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to calibre, click convert and calibre will try "
"hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However, "
"calibre accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are as "
"suitable as others for conversion to ebooks. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"calibre has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note however"
" that calibre's conversion system is not a substitute for a full blown ebook "
"editor. To edit ebooks, I recommend first converting them to EPUB or AZW3 "
"using calibre and then using the Edit Book feature to get them into perfect "
"shape. You can then use the edited ebook as input for conversion into other "
"formats in calibre."

"The transforms that act on the XHTML output are where all the work happens. "
"There are various transforms, for example, to insert book metadata as a page"

" ask calibre to convert an RTF file to EPUB, it will first be converted to "
"XHTML internally, the various transforms will be applied to the XHTML and "

"of sizes for super/sub scripts and footnotes. The font size key allows calibre"
