"The Graphical User Interface *(GUI)* provides access to all library "
"management and ebook format conversion features. The basic workflow for "
"using |app| is to first add books to the library from your hard disk. |app| "
"will automatically try to read metadata from the books and add them to its "
"internal database. Once they are in the database, you can perform various "
":ref:`actions` on them that include conversion from one format to another, "
"transfer to the reading device, viewing on your computer, and editing "
"metadata. The latter includes modifying the cover, description, and tags "
"among other details. Note that |app| creates copies of the files you add to "
"it. Your original files are left untouched."
