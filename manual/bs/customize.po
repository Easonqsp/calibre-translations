" how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to "

"calibre allows you to override the static resources, like icons, javascript "

"sub-folder of the calibre install location. On Windows, this is usually "
":file:`C:/Program Files/Calibre2/resources`. On OS X, "
":file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On linux, "
"if you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be "
":file:`/opt/calibre/resources`. These paths can change depending on where "
