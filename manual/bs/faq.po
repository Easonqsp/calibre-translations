"When adding HTML files to |app|, you may need to tell |app| what encoding "

":guilabel:`Preferences->Advanced->Plugins->File Type plugins` and customize "
"the HTML2Zip plugin, telling it what encoding your HTML files are in. Now "
"when you add HTML files to |app| they will be correctly processed. HTML "
"files from different sources often have different encodings, so you may have"
" to change this setting repeatedly. A common encoding for many files from "
"the web is ``cp1252`` and I would suggest you try that first. Note that when"

Da bi to uradili idite na :guilabel:`Podešavanja->Napredno->Dodaci->Dodatak za tip datoteke` i podesite HTML2Zip dodatak, označavajući kodnu stranu u kojoj su HTML datoteke koje koristite. Kada ste dodali HTML datoteke u |app| one će se ispravno obrađivati. HTML datoteke iz različitih izvora često koriste različite kodne strane, tako da ćete morati često mijenjati ovu postavku. Uobičajena kodna strana za većinu datoteka sa mreže je ``cp1252`` i preporučujem da prvo ovo pokušate. Napominjem da prilikom pretvaranja HTML datoteka, ostavite prazne ulazne kodne postavke koje su navedene iznad. Ovo je zbog toga što HTML2ZIP dodatak automatski pretvara HTML datoteke u standardnu kodnu stranu (utf-8)."

"When converting to MOBI, calibre detects the *metadata ToC* in the input "

"calibre whether to put it and the start or the end of the book via an option"
" in the MOBI Output settings. Remember this ToC is semantically a *metadata "
"ToC*, in any format other than MOBI it *cannot not be part of the text*. The"
" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "
"document text, create one by hand. So we strongly recommend that you leave "
"the default as it is, i.e. with the metadata ToC at the end of the book. "
"Also note that if you disable the generation of the end-of-file ToC the "

msgstr "Prilikom pretvaranja u MOBI, Calibre otkriva *Sadržaj meta podataka* u ulaznom dokumentu i kreira Sadržaj na kraju datoteke u izlaznoj MOBI datoteci. Ovo se može isključiti opcijom u MOBI Izlazne postavke. Može se naznačiti da ga Calibre stavi na početku ili na kraju knjige putem opcije u MOBI Izlazne postavke. Zapamtite da ovaj Sadržaj semantički *Sadržaj meta podataka*, u bilo kojem drugom formatu od MOBI *ne može biti dio teksta*. Činjenica da je ipak dio teksta u MOBI-ju je slučajnost koju je izazvala ograničenost MOBI-ja. Ako Sadržaj treba da bude na određenom mjestu u tekstu dokumenta, kreirajte jedan ručno. Preporučujem da ostavite preporučene vrijednost, npr. sa sadržinskim sadržajem na kraju knjige. Također možete zapaziti da ako isključite generaciju Sadržaja na kraju knjige kreirana MOBI datoteka možda neće funkcionisati kako treba u Kindle-u, iako Kindle koristi Sadržaj meta podataka za mnoge stvari, uključujući i opciju za prevrtanje strane."
