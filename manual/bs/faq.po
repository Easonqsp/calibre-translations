Kada ste dodali HTML datoteke u |app| one će se ispravno obrađivati. HTML datoteke iz različitih izvora često koriste različite kodne strane, tako da ćete morati često mijenjati ovu postavku. Uobičajena kodna strana za većinu datoteka sa mreže je ``cp1252`` i preporučujem da prvo ovo pokušate. Napominjem da prilikom pretvaranja HTML datoteka, ostavite prazne ulazne kodne postavke koje su navedene iznad.

"calibre whether to put it and the start or the end of the book via an option"
" in the MOBI Output settings. Remember this ToC is semantically a *metadata "
"ToC*, in any format other than MOBI it *cannot not be part of the text*. The"
" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "

Ovo se može isključiti opcijom u MOBI Izlazne postavke. Može se naznačiti da ga Calibre stavi na početku ili na kraju knjige putem opcije u MOBI Izlazne postavke. Zapamtite da ovaj Sadržaj semantički *Sadržaj meta podataka*, u bilo kojem drugom formatu od MOBI *ne može biti dio teksta*. Činjenica da je ipak dio teksta u MOBI-ju je slučajnost koju je izazvala ograničenost MOBI-ja. Ako Sadržaj treba da bude na određenom mjestu u tekstu dokumenta, kreirajte jedan ručno. Preporučujem da ostavite preporučene vrijednost, npr. sa sadržinskim sadržajem na kraju knjige. Također možete zapaziti da ako isključite generaciju Sadržaja na kraju knjige kreirana MOBI datoteka možda neće funkcionisati kako treba u Kindle-u, iako Kindle koristi Sadržaj meta podataka za mnoge stvari, uključujući i opciju za prevrtanje strane."
