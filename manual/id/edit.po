"In HTML any text can have significant whitespace, via the CSS white-space "
"directive. Therefore, beautification could potentially change the rendering "
"of the HTML. To avoid this as far as possible, the beautify algorithm only "
"beautifies block level tags that contain other block level tags. So, for "
"example, text inside a <p> tag will not have its whitespace changed. But a "
"<body> tag that contains only other <p> and <div> tags will be beautified.  "
"This can sometimes mean that a particular file will not be affected by "
"beautify as it has no suitable block level tags. In such cases you can try "
"different beautification tools, that are less careful, for example: `HTML "
"Tidy <http://infohound.net/tidy/>`_."
