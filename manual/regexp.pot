msgid "This is, inevitably, going to be somewhat technical- after all, regular expressions are a technical tool for doing technical stuff. I'm going to have to use some jargon and concepts that may seem complicated or convoluted. I'm going to try to explain those concepts as clearly as I can, but really can't do without using them at all. That being said, don't be discouraged by any jargon, as I've tried to explain everything new. And while regular expressions themselves may seem like an arcane, black magic (or, to be more prosaic, a random string of mumbo-jumbo letters and signs), I promise that they are not all that complicated. Even those who understand regular expressions really well have trouble reading the more complex ones, but writing them isn't as difficult- you construct the expression step by step. So, take a step and follow me into the rabbit hole."

msgid "I'm using string here in the sense it is used in programming languages: a string of one or more characters, characters including actual characters, numbers, punctuation and so-called whitespace (linebreaks, tabulators etc.). Please note that generally, uppercase and lowercase characters are not considered the same, thus \"a\" being a different character from \"A\" and so forth. In |app|, regular expressions are case insensitive in the search bar, but not in the conversion options. There's a way to make every regular expression case insensitive, but we'll discuss that later. It gets complicated because regular expressions allow for variations in the strings it matches, so one expression can match multiple strings, which is why people bother using them at all. More on that in a bit."

msgid "Well, that's why we're here. First, this is the most important concept in regular expressions: *A string by itself is a regular expression that matches itself*. That is to say, if I wanted to match the string ``\"Hello, World!\"`` using a regular expression, the regular expression to use would be ``Hello, World!``. And yes, it really is that simple. You'll notice, though, that this *only* matches the exact string ``\"Hello, World!\"``, not e.g. ``\"Hello, wOrld!\"`` or ``\"hello, world!\"`` or any other such variation."

msgid "Next is the beginning of the really good stuff. Remember where I said that regular expressions can match multiple strings? This is were it gets a little more complicated. Say, as a somewhat more practical exercise, the ebook you wanted to convert had a nasty footer counting the pages, like \"Page 5 of 423\". Obviously the page number would rise from 1 to 423, thus you'd have to match 423 different strings, right? Wrong, actually: regular expressions allow you to define sets of characters that are matched: To define a set, you put all the characters you want to be in the set into square brackets. So, for example, the set ``[abc]`` would match either the character \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\". *Sets will always only match one of the characters in the set*. They \"understand\" character ranges, that is, if you wanted to match all the lower case characters, you'd use the set ``[a-z]`` for lower- and uppercase characters you'd use ``[a-zA-Z]`` and so on. Got the idea? So, obviously, using the expression ``Page [0-9] of 423`` you'd be able to match the first 9 pages, thus reducing the expressions needed to three: The second expression ``Page [0-9][0-9] of 423`` would match all two-digit page numbers, and I'm sure you can guess what the third expression would look like. Yes, go ahead. Write it down."

msgid "I was hoping you'd say that. But brace yourself, now it gets even better! We just saw that using sets, we could match one of several characters at once. But you can even repeat a character or set, reducing the number of expressions needed to handle the above page number example to one. Yes, ONE! Excited? You should be! It works like this: Some so-called special characters, \"+\", \"?\" and \"*\", *repeat the single element preceding them*. (Element means either a single character, a character set, an escape sequence or a group (we'll learn about those last two later)- in short, any single entity in a regular expression.) These characters are called wildcards or quantifiers. To be more precise, \"?\" matches *0 or 1* of the preceding element, \"*\" matches *0 or more* of the preceding element and \"+\" matches *1 or more* of the preceding element. A few examples: The expression ``a?`` would match either \"\" (which is the empty string, not strictly useful in this case) or \"a\", the expression ``a*`` would match \"\", \"a\", \"aa\" or any number of a's in a row, and, finally, the expression ``a+`` would match \"a\", \"aa\" or any number of a's in a row (Note: it wouldn't match the empty string!). Same deal for sets: The expression ``[0-9]+`` would match *every integer number there is*! I know what you're thinking, and you're right: If you use that in the above case of matching page numbers, wouldn't that be the single one expression to match all the page numbers? Yes, the expression ``Page [0-9]+ of 423`` would match every page number in that book!"

msgid "A note on these quantifiers: They generally try to match as much text as possible, so be careful when using them. This is called \"greedy behaviour\"- I'm sure you get why. It gets problematic when you, say, try to match a tag. Consider, for example, the string ``\"<p class=\"calibre2\">Title here</p>\"`` and let's say you'd want to match the opening tag (the part between the first pair of angle brackets, a little more on tags later). You'd think that the expression ``<p.*>`` would match that tag, but actually, it matches the whole string! (The character \".\" is another special character. It matches anything *except* linebreaks, so, basically, the expression ``.*`` would match any single line you can think of.) Instead, try using ``<p.*?>`` which makes the quantifier ``\"*\"`` non-greedy. That expression would only match the first opening tag, as intended. There's actually another way to accomplish this: The expression ``<p[^>]*>`` will match that same opening tag- you'll see why after the next section. Just note that there quite frequently is more than one way to write a regular expression."

This pair of a backslash followed by a single character is called an escape sequence, and the act of putting a backslash in front of a special character is called escaping that character. An escape sequence is interpreted as a single element. There are of course escape sequences that do more than just escaping special characters, for example ``\"\\t\"`` means a tabulator. We'll get to some of the escape sequences later. Oh, and by the way, concerning those special characters: Consider any character we discuss in this introduction as having some function to be special and thus needing to be escaped if you want the literal character."

Thus, ``[^a]`` would match any character excluding \"a\". That's called complementing the set. Those escape sequence shorthands we saw earlier can also be complemented: ``\"\\D\"`` means any non-number character, thus being equivalent to ``[^0-9]``. The other shorthands can be complemented by, you guessed it, using the respective uppercase letter instead of the lowercase one. So, going back to the example ``<p[^>]*>`` from the previous section, now you can see that the character set it's using tries to match any character except for a closing angle bracket."

msgid "Fear not, life still is good and easy. Consider this example: The book you're converting has \"Title\" written on every odd page and \"Author\" written on every even page. Looks great in print, right? But in ebooks, it's annoying. You can group whole expressions in normal parentheses, and the character ``\"|\"`` will let you match *either* the expression to its right *or* the one to its left. Combine those and you're done. Too fast for you? Okay, first off, we group the expressions for odd and even pages, thus getting ``(Title)(Author)`` as our two needed expressions. Now we make things simpler by using the vertical bar (``\"|\"`` is called the vertical bar character): If you use the expression ``(Title|Author)`` you'll either get a match for \"Title\" (on the odd pages) or you'd match \"Author\" (on the even pages).

Well, the vertical bar works a little differently: The expression \"Title|Author\" will also match either the string \"Title\" or the string \"Author\", just as the above example using grouping. *The vertical bar selects between the entire expression preceding and following it*. So, if you wanted to match the strings \"Calibre\" and \"calibre\" and wanted to select only between the upper- and lowercase \"c\", you'd have to use the expression ``(c|C)alibre``, where the grouping ensures that only the \"c\" will be selected. If you were to use ``c|Calibre``, you'd get a match on the string \"c\" or on the string \"Calibre\", which isn't what we wanted. In short: If in doubt, use grouping together with the vertical bar."

msgid "(shamelessly ripped out of `this thread <http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=75594\">`_). You'd have to remove some of the tags as well. In this example, I'd recommend beginning with the tag ``<b class=\"calibre2\">``, now you have to end with the corresponding closing tag (opening tags are ``<tag>``, closing tags are ``</tag>``), which is simply the next ``</b>`` in this case. (Refer to a good HTML manual or ask in the forum if you are unclear on this point.) The opening tag can be described using ``<b.*?>``, the closing tag using ``</b>``, thus we could remove everything between those tags using ``<b.*?>.*?</b>``. But using this expression would be a bad idea, because it removes everything enclosed by <b>- tags (which, by the way, render the enclosed text in bold print), and it's a fair bet that we'll remove portions of the book in this way. Instead, include the beginning of the enclosed string as well, making the regular expression ``<b.*?>\\s*Generated\\s+by\\s+ABC\\s+Amber\\s+LIT.*?</b>`` The ``\\s`` with quantifiers are included here instead of explicitly using the spaces as seen in the string to catch any variations of the string that might occur. Remember to check what |app| will remove to make sure you don't remove any portions you want to keep if you test a new expression. If you only check one occurrence, you might miss a mismatch somewhere else in the text. Also note that should you accidentally remove more or fewer tags than you actually wanted to, |app| tries to repair the damaged code after doing the removal."

There's a special feature here: You can use field names for metadata fields, for example ``(?P<title>)`` would indicate that calibre uses this part of the string as book title. The allowed field names are listed in the windows, together with another nice test field. An example: Say you want to import a whole bunch of files named like ``Classical Texts: The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.mobi``. (Obviously, this is already in your library, since we all love classical italian poetry) or ``Science Fiction epics: The Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov.epub``. This is obviously a naming scheme that |app| won't extract any meaningful data out of - its standard expression for extracting metadata is ``(?P<title>.+) - (?P<author>[^_]+)``. A regular expression that works here would be ``[a-zA-Z]+: (?P<title>.+) by (?P<author>.+)``. Please note that, inside the group for the metadata field, you need to use expressions to describe what the field actually matches. And also note that, when using the test field |app| provides, you need to add the file extension to your testing filename, otherwise you won't get any matches at all, despite using a working expression."

Be very careful when using this last feature, as it can do **Very Bad Things** to your library! Doublecheck that your expressions do what you want them to using the test fields, and only mark the books you really want to change! In the regular expression search mode, you can search in one field, replace the text with something and even write the result into another field. A practical example: Say your library contained the books of Frank Herbert's Dune series, named after the fashion ``Dune 1 - Dune``, ``Dune 2 - Dune Messiah`` and so on. Now you want to get ``Dune`` into the series field. You can do that by searching for ``(.*?) \\d+ - .*`` in the title field and replacing it with ``\\1`` in the series field. See what I did there? That's a reference to the first group you're replacing the series field with. Now that you have the series all set, you only need to do another search for ``.*? -`` in the title field and replace it with ``\"\"`` (an empty string), again in the title field, and your metadata is all neat and tidy. Isn't that great? By the way, instead of replacing the entire field, you can also append or prepend to the field, so, if you *wanted* the book title to be prepended with series info, you could do that as well.
