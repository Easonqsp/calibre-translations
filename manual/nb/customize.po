"|app| allows you to override the static resources, like icons, javascript "
"and templates for the metadata jacket, catalogs, etc. with customized "
"versions that you like.  All static resources are stored in the resources "
"sub-folder of the calibre install location. On Windows, this is usually "
":file:`C:/Program Files/Calibre2/resources`. On OS X, "
":file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On linux, "
"if you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be "
":file:`/opt/calibre/resources`. These paths can change depending on where "
"you choose to install |app|."
