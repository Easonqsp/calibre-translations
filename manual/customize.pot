msgid "calibre has a highly modular design. Various parts of it can be customized. You can learn how to create *recipes* to add new sources of online content to calibre in the Section :ref:`news`. Here, you will learn, first, how to use environment variables and *tweaks* to customize calibre's behavior,  and then how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to override the defaults and finally how to use *plugins* to add functionality to calibre."

All static resources are stored in the resources sub-folder of the calibre install location. On Windows, this is usually :file:`C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Calibre2\\\\resources`. On OS X, :file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On linux, if you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be :file:`/opt/calibre/resources`. These paths can change depending on where you choose to install calibre."

In this configuration directory, create a sub-folder called resources and place the files you want to override in it. Place the files in the appropriate sub folders, for example place images in :file:`resources/images`, etc. calibre will automatically use your custom file in preference to the built-in one the next time it is started."
