msgid "calibre has a highly modular design. Various parts of it can be customized. You can learn how to create *recipes* to add new sources of online content to calibre in the Section :ref:`news`. Here, you will learn, first, how to use environment variables and *tweaks* to customize calibre's behavior,  and then how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to override the defaults and finally how to use *plugins* to add functionality to calibre."

On OS X, :file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On linux, if you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be :file:`/opt/calibre/resources`.
