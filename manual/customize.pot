msgid "|app| has a highly modular design. Various parts of it can be customized. You can learn how to create *recipes* to add new sources of online content to |app| in the Section :ref:`news`. Here, you will learn, first, how to use environment variables and *tweaks* to customize |app|'s behavior,  and then how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to override the defaults and finally how to use *plugins* to add functionality to |app|."

msgid "|app| allows you to override the static resources, like icons, javascript and templates for the metadata jacket, catalogs, etc. with customized versions that you like.  All static resources are stored in the resources sub-folder of the calibre install location. On Windows, this is usually :file:`C:/Program Files/Calibre2/resources`. On OS X, :file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On linux, if you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be :file:`/opt/calibre/resources`. These paths can change depending on where you choose to install |app|."

Instead, go to :guilabel:`Preferences->Advanced->Miscellaneous` and click :guilabel:`Open calibre configuration directory`. In this configuration directory, create a sub-folder called resources and place the files you want to override in it. Place the files in the appropriate sub folders, for example place images in :file:`resources/images`, etc. |app| will automatically use your custom file in preference to the built-in one the next time it is started."

Assuming you have an alternate icon in PNG format called :file:`mytrash.png` you would save it in the configuration directory as :file:`resources/images/trash.png`. All the icons used by the calibre user interface are in :file:`resources/images` and its sub-folders."
