"When converting to MOBI, calibre detects the *metadata ToC* in the input "

"calibre whether to put it and the start or the end of the book via an option"
" in the MOBI Output settings. Remember this ToC is semantically a *metadata "
"ToC*, in any format other than MOBI it *cannot not be part of the text*. The"
" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "
"document text, create one by hand. So we strongly recommend that you leave "
"the default as it is, i.e. with the metadata ToC at the end of the book. "
"Also note that if you disable the generation of the end-of-file ToC the "
