"calibre has a very modular design. Almost all functionality in calibre comes"
" in the form of plugins. Plugins are used for conversion, for downloading "
"news (though these are called recipes), for various components of the user "
"interface, to connect to different devices, to process files when adding "
"them to calibre and so on. You can get a complete list of all the built-in "
"plugins in calibre by going to :guilabel:`Preferences->Plugins`."
msgstr "calibre ma budowę dużym stopniu modularną. Niemal wszystkie funkcje w calibre są dostarczane w postaci wtyczek. Wtyczki są używane do konwersji, pobierania wiadomości, do różnych komponentów interfejsu, łączenia z różnymi urządzeniami, przetwarzania plików podczas dodawania ich do calibre itp. Pełną listę wbudowanych wtyczek można uzyskać w :guilabel:`Preferences->Plugins`."
