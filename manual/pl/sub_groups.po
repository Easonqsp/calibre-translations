"Some people wish to organize the books in their library into subgroups, "
"similar to subfolders. The most commonly provided reason is to create genre "

" textbooks by subject and course number. Another wanted to keep track of "
"gifts by subject and recipient. This tutorial will use the genre example for"

"twice, once under History and once under Science Fiction. Because the genres"
