"simplest way to change metadata in calibre is to simply double click on an "

"Regular expression mode has some differences from character mode, beyond (of"

"to parts of the search string by using backreferences. A backreference is "

"\\\\2 \\\\1`, the result will be `a cat bad`. Please see the "
