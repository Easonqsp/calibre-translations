"The Graphical User Interface *(GUI)* provides access to all library "
"management and ebook format conversion features. The basic workflow for "
"using |app| is to first add books to the library from your hard disk. |app| "
"will automatically try to read metadata from the books and add them to its "
"internal database. Once they are in the database, you can perform various "
":ref:`actions` on them that include conversion from one format to another, "
"transfer to the reading device, viewing on your computer, and editing "
"metadata. The latter includes modifying the cover, description, and tags "
"among other details. Note that |app| creates copies of the files you add to "
"it. Your original files are left untouched."

"The first click on an item will restrict the list of books to those that "
"contain or match the item. Continuing the above example, clicking on Isaac "
"Asimov will show books by that author. Clicking again on the item will "
"change what is shown, depending on whether the item has children (see sub-"
"categories and hierarchical items below). Continuing the Isaac Asimov "
"example, clicking again on Isaac Asimov will restrict the list of books to "
"those not by Isaac Asimov. A third click will remove the restriction, "
"showing all books. If you hold down the Ctrl or Shift keys and click on "
"multiple items, then restrictions based on multiple items are created. For "
"example you could hold Ctrl and click on the tags History and Europe for "
"finding books on European history. The Tag Browser works by constructing "
"search expressions that are automatically entered into the Search bar. "
"Looking at what the Tag Browser generates is a good way to learn how to "
"construct basic search expressions."
