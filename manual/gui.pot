msgid "The Graphical User Interface *(GUI)* provides access to all library management and ebook format conversion features. The basic workflow for using |app| is to first add books to the library from your hard disk. |app| will automatically try to read metadata from the books and add them to its internal database. Once they are in the database, you can perform various :ref:`actions` on them that include conversion from one format to another, transfer to the reading device, viewing on your computer, and editing metadata. The latter includes modifying the cover, description, and tags among other details. Note that |app| creates copies of the files you add to it. Your original files are left untouched."
