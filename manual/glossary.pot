msgid "**RSS** *(Really Simple Syndication)* is a web feed format that is used to publish frequently updated content, like news articles, blog posts, etc. It is a format that is particularly suited to being read by computers, and is therefore the preferred way of getting content from the web into an ebook. There are many other feed formats in use on the Internet, and |app| understands most of them. In particular, it has good support for the *ATOM* format, which is commonly used for blogs."

msgid "A recipe is a set of instructions that teach |app| how to convert an online news source, such as a magazine or a blog, into an ebook. A recipe is essentially `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ code. As such, it is capable of converting arbitrarily complex news sources into ebooks. At the simplest level, it is just a set of variables, such as URLs, that give |app| enough information to go out onto the Internet and download the news."
