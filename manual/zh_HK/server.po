"Here, we will show you how to integrate the calibre Content server into "
"another server. The most common reason for this is to make use of SSL or "
"more sophisticated authentication. The basic technique is to run the calibre"
" server and setup reverse proxying to it from the main server."

msgid ""
"A reverse proxy is when your normal server accepts incoming requests and "
"passes them onto the calibre server. It then reads the response from the "
"calibre server and forwards it to the client. This means that you can simply"
" run the calibre server as normal without trying to integrate it closely "
"with your main server, and you can take advantage of whatever authentication"
" systems your main server has in place."

"The key parameter here is ``--url-prefix /calibre``. This causes the Content"

"The exact technique for enabling the proxy modules will vary depending on "

"That's all, you will now be able to access the calibre Content server under "

"under /calibre to the calibre server running on port 8080 and thanks to the "
"--url-prefix option above, the calibre server handles them transparently."
