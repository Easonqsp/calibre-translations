"|app| has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to |app|, click convert and |app| will try "
"hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However, "
"|app| accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are as "
"suitable as others for conversion to ebooks. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"|app| has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note however"
" that |app|'s conversion system is not a substitute for a full blown ebook "
"editor. To edit ebooks, I recommend first converting them to EPUB or AZW3 "
"using |app| and then using the Edit Book feature to get them into perfect "
"shape. You can then use the edited ebook as input for conversion into other "
"formats in |app|."
