"The Graphical User Interface *(GUI)* provides access to all library "
"management and ebook format conversion features. The basic workflow for "
"using calibre is to first add books to the library from your hard disk. "
"calibre will automatically try to read metadata from the books and add them "
"to its internal database. Once they are in the database, you can perform "
"various :ref:`actions` on them that include conversion from one format to "
"another, transfer to the reading device, viewing on your computer, and "
"editing metadata. The latter includes modifying the cover, description, and "
"tags among other details. Note that calibre creates copies of the files you "
"add to it. Your original files are left untouched."
