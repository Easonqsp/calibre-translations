"Here, we will show you how to integrate the calibre content server into "
"another server. The most common reason for this is to make use of SSL or "
"more sophisticated authentication. There are two main techniques: Running "
"the calibre content server as a standalone process and using a reverse proxy"
" to connect it with your main server or running the content server in "
"process in your main server with WSGI. The examples below are all for Apache"
" 2.x on linux, but should be easily adaptable to other platforms."

"A reverse proxy is when your normal server accepts incoming requests and "
"passes them onto the calibre server. It then reads the response from the "
"calibre server and forwards it to the client. This means that you can simply"
" run the calibre server as normal without trying to integrate it closely "
"with your main server, and you can take advantage of whatever authentication"
" systems your main server has in place. This is the simplest approach as it "
"allows you to use the binary calibre install with no external "
"dependencies/system integration requirements. Below, is an example of how to"
" achieve this with Apache as your main server, but it will work with any "
"server that supports Reverse Proxies."
