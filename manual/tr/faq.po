"When converting to MOBI, calibre detects the *metadata ToC* in the input "

"calibre whether to put it and the start or the end of the book via an option"

"ToC*, in any format other than MOBI it *cannot not be part of the text*. The"
" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "
"document text, create one by hand. So we strongly recommend that you leave "
