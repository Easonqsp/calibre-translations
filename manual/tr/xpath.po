"In this tutorial, you will be given a gentle introduction to `XPath "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath>`_, a query language that can be used to"
" select arbitrary parts of `HTML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_ "
"documents in calibre. XPath is a widely used standard, and googling it will "
"yield a ton of information. This tutorial, however, focuses on using XPath "
"for ebook related tasks like finding chapter headings in an unstructured "
"HTML document."

"Now suppose you want to select both ``<h1>`` and ``<h2>`` tags. To do that, "
"we need a XPath construct called *predicate*. A :dfn:`predicate` is simply a"

"this tutorial progresses, you will see more powerful examples. A predicate "
"is created by enclosing the test expression in square brackets::"

"There are several new features in this XPath expression. The first is the "
"use of the wildcard ``*``. It means *match any tag*. Now look at the test "
"expression ``name()='h1' or name()='h2'``. :term:`name()` is an example of a"
" *built-in function*. It simply evaluates to the name of the tag. So by "
"using it, we can select tags whose names are either `h1` or `h2`. Note that "
"the :term:`name()` function ignores namespaces so that there is no need for "
"the ``h:`` prefix. XPath has several useful built-in functions. A few more "
"will be introduced in this tutorial."
