"Often when editing EPUB files that you get from somewhere, you will find "
"that the files inside the EPUB are arranged haphazardly, in different sub-"
"folders. This tool allows you to automatically move all files into sub-"
"folders based on their types. Access it via :guilabel:`Tools->Arrange into "
"folders`. Note that this tool only changes how the files are arranged inside"
" the EPUB, it does not change how they are displayed in the Files Browser."
