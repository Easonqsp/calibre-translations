"The calibre editor supports *snippets*. A snippet is a piece of text that is"
" either re-used often or contains a lot of redundant text. The editor allows"
" you to insert a snippet with only a few key strokes. For example, suppose "
"you often find yourself inserting link tags when editing HTML files, then "
"you can simply type ``<a`` in the editor and press |ct|. The editor will "
"expand it to::"
