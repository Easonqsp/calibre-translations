"**RSS** *(Really Simple Syndication)* is a web feed format that is used to "
"publish frequently updated content, like news articles, blog posts, etc. It "
"is a format that is particularly suited to being read by computers, and is "
"therefore the preferred way of getting content from the web into an ebook. "
"There are many other feed formats in use on the Internet, and calibre "
"understands most of them. In particular, it has good support for the *ATOM* "
"format, which is commonly used for blogs."

"A recipe is a set of instructions that teach calibre how to convert an online "
"news source, such as a magazine or a blog, into an ebook. A recipe is "
"essentially `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ code. As such, it is capable "
"of converting arbitrarily complex news sources into ebooks. At the simplest "
"level, it is just a set of variables, such as URLs, that give calibre enough "
"information to go out onto the Internet and download the news."
