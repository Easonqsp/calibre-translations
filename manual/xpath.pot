msgid "In this tutorial, you will be given a gentle introduction to `XPath <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath>`_, a query language that can be used to select arbitrary parts of `HTML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_ documents in |app|. XPath is a widely used standard, and googling it will yield a ton of information. This tutorial, however, focuses on using XPath for ebook related tasks like finding chapter headings in an unstructured HTML document."

msgid "There are several new features in this XPath expression. The first is the use of the wildcard ``*``. It means *match any tag*. Now look at the test expression ``name()='h1' or name()='h2'``. :term:`name()` is an example of a *built-in function*. It simply evaluates to the name of the tag. So by using it, we can select tags whose names are either `h1` or `h2`. Note that the :term:`name()` function ignores namespaces so that there is no need for the ``h:`` prefix. XPath has several useful built-in functions. A few more will be introduced in this tutorial."
