msgid "In this tutorial, you will be given a gentle introduction to `XPath <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath>`_, a query language that can be used to select arbitrary parts of `HTML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_ documents in |app|. XPath is a widely used standard, and googling it will yield a ton of information. This tutorial, however, focuses on using XPath for ebook related tasks like finding chapter headings in an unstructured HTML document."

The ``h:`` prefix in the above examples is needed to match XHTML tags. This is because internally, |app| represents all content as XHTML. In XHTML tags have a *namespace*, and ``h:`` is the namespace prefix for HTML tags."

Tests can be arbitrarily powerful and as this tutorial progresses, you will see more powerful examples. A predicate is created by enclosing the test expression in square brackets::"

msgid "There are several new features in this XPath expression. The first is the use of the wildcard ``*``. It means *match any tag*. Now look at the test expression ``name()='h1' or name()='h2'``. :term:`name()` is an example of a *built-in function*. It simply evaluates to the name of the tag. So by using it, we can select tags whose names are either `h1` or `h2`. Note that the :term:`name()` function ignores namespaces so that there is no need for the ``h:`` prefix. XPath has several useful built-in functions. A few more will be introduced in this tutorial."
