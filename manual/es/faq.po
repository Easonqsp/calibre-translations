"Finally, the reason there are numbers at the end of every title folder, is "
"for *robustness*. That number is the id number of the book record in the "
"calibre database. The presence of the number allows you to have multiple "
"records with the same title and author names. It is also part of what allows"
" calibre to magically regenerate the database with all metadata if the "
"database file gets corrupted. Given that calibre's mission is to get you to "
"stop storing metadata in filenames and stop using the filesystem to find "
"things, the increased robustness afforded by the id numbers is well worth "
"the uglier folder names."
