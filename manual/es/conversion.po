"calibre has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to calibre, click convert and calibre will try"
" hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However,"
" calibre accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are "
"as suitable as others for conversion to ebooks. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"calibre has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note "
"however that calibre's conversion system is not a substitute for a full "
"blown ebook editor. To edit ebooks, I recommend first converting them to "
"EPUB or AZW3 using calibre and then using the Edit Book feature to get them "
"into perfect shape. You can then use the edited ebook as input for "
"conversion into other formats in calibre."
msgstr "calibre tiene un sistema de conversión diseñado para que sea fácil de usar. Normalmente no tiene más que añadir un libro a calibre, pulsar en convertir y calibre intentará generar una salida tan parecida como sea posible a la entrada. Sin embargo, calibre acepta un gran número de formatos de entrada, y no todos son tan adecuados como otros para convertirse a otros formatos. En el caso de los formatos menos adecuados, o si simplemente desea tener mayor control sobre el sistema de conversión, calibre tiene muchas opciones para ajustar los detalles del sistema de conversion. Tenga en cuenta que el sistema de conversión de calibre no es un sustituto para un editor completo de libros electrónicos. Para modificar libros le recomiendo que los convierta primero a EPUB o AZW3 con cailbre y luego use la función :guilabel:`Modificar libro` para darle la forma perfecta. Después puede usar el libro modificado como entrada para otros formatos en calibre."
