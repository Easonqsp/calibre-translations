"calibre has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to calibre, click convert and calibre will try"
" hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However,"
" calibre accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are "
"as suitable as others for conversion to ebooks. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"calibre has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note "
"however that calibre's conversion system is not a substitute for a full "
"blown ebook editor. To edit ebooks, I recommend first converting them to "
"EPUB or AZW3 using calibre and then using the Edit Book feature to get them "
"into perfect shape. You can then use the edited ebook as input for "
"conversion into other formats in calibre."
