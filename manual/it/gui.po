"The Graphical User Interface *(GUI)* provides access to all library "
"management and ebook format conversion features. The basic workflow for "
"using calibre is to first add books to the library from your hard disk. "
"calibre will automatically try to read metadata from the books and add them "
"to its internal database. Once they are in the database, you can perform "
"various :ref:`actions` on them that include conversion from one format to "
"another, transfer to the reading device, viewing on your computer, and "
"editing metadata. The latter includes modifying the cover, description, and "
"tags among other details. Note that calibre creates copies of the files you "
"add to it. Your original files are left untouched."
msgstr "Tramite l'Interfaccia Grafica  *(GUI)*  si può accedere alle funzionalità di gestione della libreria e di converione degli ebooks nei vari formati. Il procedimento di base per utilizzare lappl prevede, come primo passaggio, di caricare dei libri presenti sul tuo hard disk all'interno della libreria. lappl autometicamente cercherà di reperire i metadata dai libiri e di aggiungerli al proprio database interno. Una volta caricati i libri nel database, potrai iniziare a fare alcune :ref:`actions` su di loro, tra cui convertire gli ebook da un formato all'altro, trasferire i libri su un dispositivo di lettura, leggere i libri sul tuo computer e modificare i metadata. Le azioni sui metadata consentono, tra le altre cose, di modificare la copertina, la descrizione e le etichette. Nota che lappl crea una copia dei file che tu aggiungi. I files originali non sono modificati."
