"coding for that element and more importantly, the CSS styles that apply to "
"it. You can even dynamically edit the styles and see what effect your "
"changes have instantly. Note that editing the styles does not actually make "
"changes to the book contents, it only allows for quick experimentation. The "
"ability to live edit inside the Inspector is under development."
