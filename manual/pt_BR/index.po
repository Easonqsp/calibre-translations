"anything with your ebooks, it first has to know about them. Drag and drop a "
"few ebook files into calibre, or click the \"Add books\" button and browse "
"for the ebooks you want to work with. Once you've added the books, they will"

"Once you've admired the list of books you just added to your heart's "
"content, you'll probably want to read one. In order to do that you'll have "
"to convert the book to a format your reader understands. When first running "
"calibre, the Welcome Wizard starts and will set up calibre for your reader "
"device. Conversion is a breeze. Just select the book you want to convert "
"then click the \"Convert books\" button. Ignore all the options for now and "
"click \"OK\". The little icon in the bottom right corner will start "
"spinning. Once it's finished spinning, your converted book is ready. Click "
"the \"View\" button to read the book."

"If you want to read the book on your reader, connect it to the computer, "
"wait till calibre detects it (10-20 seconds) and then click the \"Send to "
"device\" button. Once the icon stops spinning again, disconnect your reader "
"and read away! If you didn't convert the book in the previous step, calibre "
"will auto convert it to the format your reader device understands."
