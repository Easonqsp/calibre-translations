"In HTML any text can have significant whitespace, via the CSS white-space "

"<body> tag that contains only other <p> and <div> tags will be beautified.  "
"This can sometimes mean that a particular file will not be affected by "

"different beautification tools, that are less careful, for example: `HTML "
