The simplest way to change metadata in |app| is to simply double click on an entry and type in the correct replacement. For more sophisticated, \"power editing\" use the edit metadata tools discussed below."

If no matches are found, try making your search a little less specific by including only some key words in the title and only the author last name."

You can add a new format, delete an existing format and also ask |app| to set the metadata and cover for the book entry from the metadata in one of the formats."

This is particularly useful if you have just imported a number of books that have some metadata in common. This dialog is very powerful, for example, it has a Search and Replace tab that you can use to perform bulk operations on metadata and even copy metadata from one column to another."

msgid "As noted above, there are two search and replace modes: character match and regular expression. Character match will look in the `Search field` you choose for the characters you type in the `search for` box and replace those characters with what you type in the `replace with` box. Each occurance of the search characters in the field will be replaced. For example, assume the field being searched contains `a bad cat`. if you search for `a` to be replaced with `HELLO`, then the result will be `HELLO bHELLOd cHELLOt`."

msgid "Regular expression mode has some differences from character mode, beyond (of course) using regular expressions. The first is that functions are applied to the parts of the string matched by the search string, not the entire field. The second is that functions apply to the replacement string, not to the entire field."

#: ../../metadata.rst:75
# b363904fba354126af31bde62f37ff2f
msgid "The third and most important is that the replace string can make reference to parts of the search string by using backreferences. A backreference is ``\\\\n`` where n is an integer that refers to the n'th parenthesized group in the search expression. For example, given the same example as above, `a bad cat`, a search expression `a (...) (...)`, and a replace expression `a \\\\2 \\\\1`, the result will be `a cat bad`. Please see the :ref:`regexptutorial` for more information on backreferences."

msgid "One useful pattern: assume you want to change the case of an entire field. The easiest way to do this is to use character mode, but lets further assume you want to use regular expression mode. The search expression should be `(.*)` the replace expression should be `\\\\1`, and the desired case change function should be selected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../metadata.rst:79
# 06c96ea38cac4cdbbb5af885ed1dc257
msgid "Finally, in regular expression mode you can copy values from one field to another. Simply make the source and destination field different. The copy can replace the destination field, prepend to the field (add to the front), or append to the field (add at the end). The 'use comma' checkbox tells |app| to (or not to) add a comma between the text and the destination field in prepend and append modes. If the destination is multiple (e.g., tags), then you cannot uncheck this box."

# 8b1c6a05a39d4c0f8aa152f6f74c3df1
msgid "Search and replace is done after all the other metadata changes in the other tabs are applied. This can lead to some confusion, because the test boxes will show the information before the other changes, but the operation will be applied after the other changes. If you have any doubts about what is going to happen, do not mix search/replace with other changes."
