msgid "Ebooks come in all shapes and sizes and more often than not, their metadata (things like title/author/series/publisher) is incomplete or incorrect. The simplest way to change metadata in calibre is to simply double click on an entry and type in the correct replacement. For more sophisticated, \"power editing\" use the edit metadata tools discussed below."

If no matches are found, try making your search a little less specific by including only some key words in the title and only the author last name."

In the :guilabel:`Available formats` section of the Edit metadata dialog, you can manage these formats. You can add a new format, delete an existing format and also ask calibre to set the metadata and cover for the book entry from the metadata in one of the formats."

Character match will look in the `Search field` you choose for the characters you type in the `search for` box and replace those characters with what you type in the `replace with` box. Each occurance of the search characters in the field will be replaced. For example, assume the field being searched contains `a bad cat`. if you search for `a` to be replaced with `HELLO`, then the result will be `HELLO bHELLOd cHELLOt`."

msgid "The third and most important is that the replace string can make reference to parts of the search string by using backreferences. A backreference is ``\\\\n`` where n is an integer that refers to the n'th parenthesized group in the search expression. For example, given the same example as above, `a bad cat`, a search expression `a (...) (...)`, and a replace expression `a \\\\2 \\\\1`, the result will be `a cat bad`.

The search expression should be `(.*)` the replace expression should be `\\\\1`, and the desired case change function should be selected."

msgid "Finally, in regular expression mode you can copy values from one field to another. Simply make the source and destination field different. The copy can replace the destination field, prepend to the field (add to the front), or append to the field (add at the end). The 'use comma' checkbox tells calibre to (or not to) add a comma between the text and the destination field in prepend and append modes. If the destination is multiple (e.g., tags), then you cannot uncheck this box."

This can lead to some confusion, because the test boxes will show the information before the other changes, but the operation will be applied after the other changes. If you have any doubts about what is going to happen, do not mix search/replace with other changes."
