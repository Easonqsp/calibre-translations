msgid "Some people wish to organize the books in their library into subgroups, similar to subfolders. The most commonly provided reason is to create genre hierarchies, but there are many others. One user asked for a way to organize textbooks by subject and course number. Another wanted to keep track of gifts by subject and recipient. This tutorial will use the genre example for the rest of this post."

Clicking on that triangle will open the item and show the sub-genres, as you can see with History and Science Fiction."

For example, clicking on Science Fiction can give all three of the child genres, Alternate History, Military, and Space Opera. Clicking on Alternate History will give books in that genre, ignoring those in Military and Space Opera. Of course, a book can have multiple genres. If a book has both Space Opera and Military genres, then you will see that book if you click on either genre. Searching is discussed in more detail below."

Because the genres are in a hierarchy, these are two separate genres. A book can be in one, the other, or (doubtfully in this case) both. For example, the books in Winston Churchill's \"The Second World War\" could be in \"History.Military\". David Weber's Honor Harrington books could be in \"Science Fiction.Military\", and for that matter also in \"Science Fiction.Space Opera.\""

How do you search for books with only \"History\"?"

Continuing our example, you can create a saved search named 'History.Japanese' by first clicking on the genre Japanese in the tag browser to get a search into the search box, entering History.Japanese into the saved search box, then pushing the \"save search\" button (the green box with the white plus, on the right-hand side)."
