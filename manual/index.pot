msgid "Once you've admired the list of books you just added to your heart's content, you'll probably want to read one. In order to do that you'll have to convert the book to a format your reader understands. When first running calibre, the Welcome Wizard starts and will set up calibre for your reader device. Conversion is a breeze. Just select the book you want to convert then click the \"Convert books\" button. Ignore all the options for now and click \"OK\". The little icon in the bottom right corner will start spinning. Once it's finished spinning, your converted book is ready. Click the \"View\" button to read the book."

Once the icon stops spinning again, disconnect your reader and read away! If you didn't convert the book in the previous step, calibre will auto convert it to the format your reader device understands."
