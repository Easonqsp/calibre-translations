Instead, as you read through the book, you will notice that your position in the book is displayed in the upper left corner in a box like this |navposi|. This is both your current position and the total length of the book. These numbers are independent of the screen size and font size you are viewing the book at, and they play a similar role to page numbers in paper books. You can enter any number you like to go to the corresponding location in the book."
