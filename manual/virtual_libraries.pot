msgid "In calibre, a virtual library is a way to tell calibre to open only a subset of a normal library. For example, you might want to only work with books by a certain author, or books having only a certain tag. Using virtual libraries is the preferred way of partitioning your large book collection into smaller sub collections. It is superior to splitting up your library into multiple smaller libraries as, when you want to search through your entire collection, you can simply go back to the full library. There is no way to search through multiple separate libraries simultaneously in calibre."

msgid "A virtual library is different from a simple search. A search will only restrict the list of books shown in the book list. A virtual library does that, and in addition it also restricts the entries shown in the :guilabel:`Tag Browser` to the left. The Tag Browser will only show tags, authors, series, publishers, etc. that come from the books in the virtual library. A virtual library thus behaves as though the actual library contains only the restricted set of books."

First, type in the search you want to use in the search bar or build a search using the :guilabel:`Tag Browser`. When you are happy with the returned results, click the Virtual Library button, choose Create Library and enter a name for the new virtual library. The virtual library will then be created based on the search you just typed in. Searches are very powerful, for examples of the kinds of things you can do with them, see :ref:`search_interface`."
