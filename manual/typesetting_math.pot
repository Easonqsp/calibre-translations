msgid "The calibre ebook viewer has the ability to display math embedded in ebooks (ePub and HTML files). You can typeset the math directly with TeX or MathML or AsciiMath. The calibre viewer uses the excellent `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org>`_ library to do this. This is a brief tutorial on creating ebooks with math in them that work well with the calibre viewer."

msgid "You can write mathematics inline inside a simple HTML file and the calibre viewer will render it into properly typeset mathematics. In the example below, we use TeX notation for mathematics. You will see that you can use normal TeX commands, with the small caveat that ampersands and less than and greater than signs have to be written as &amp; &lt; and &gt; respectively."
