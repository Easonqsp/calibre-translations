"To use it, either open the ebook in the tool for :ref:`edit` and then click "
":guilabel:`File->Compare to other book` or use the :ref:`book_details` "
"panel. If you do a conversion from EPUB to EPUB, the original EPUB file will"
" be saved as ORIGINAL_EPUB. Simply right click on the ORIGINAL_EPUB entry in"
" the Book Details panel and choose :guilabel:`Compare to EPUB format`."

"One useful technique when comparing books is to tell the comparison tool to "
"beautify the text and style files before calculating differences. This can "
"often result in cleaner and easier to follow differences. To do this, click "
"the :guilabel:`Options` button in the bottom right and choose "
":guilabel:`Beautify files before comparing`. Note that beautifying can "
"sometimes have undesired effects, as it can cause invalid markup to be "
"altered to make it valid. You can also change the number of lines of context"
" shown around differences via the :guilabel:`Options` button."
