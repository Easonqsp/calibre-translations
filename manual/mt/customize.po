"calibre has a highly modular design. Various parts of it can be customized. "
"You can learn how to create *recipes* to add new sources of online content "
"to calibre in the Section :ref:`news`. Here, you will learn, first, how to "
"use environment variables and *tweaks* to customize calibre's behavior,  and"
" then how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to "
"override the defaults and finally how to use *plugins* to add functionality "
"to calibre."

"calibre allows you to override the static resources, like icons, javascript "

":file:`C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Calibre2\\\\resources`. On OS X, "
":file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On linux, "
"if you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be "
":file:`/opt/calibre/resources`. These paths can change depending on where "
