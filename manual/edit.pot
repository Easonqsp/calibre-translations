However, be aware that once the fonts are subset, if you add new text whose characters are not previously present in the subset font, the font will not work for the new text.

To avoid this as far as possible, the beautify algorithm only beautifies block level tags that contain other block level tags. So, for example, text inside a <p> tag will not have its whitespace changed. But a <body> tag that contains only other <p> and <div> tags will be beautified.  This can sometimes mean that a particular file will not be affected by beautify as it has no suitable block level tags.
