This commonly reduces the size of the font files by ~ 50%. However, be aware that once the fonts are subset, if you add new text whose characters are not previously present in the subset font, the font will not work for the new text.

To avoid this as far as possible, the beautify algorithm only beautifies block level tags that contain other block level tags. So, for example, text inside a <p> tag will not have its whitespace changed. But a <body> tag that contains only other <p> and <div> tags will be beautified.  This can sometimes mean that a particular file will not be affected by beautify as it has no suitable block level tags.

msgid "Note that unlike most other completion systems, the editor's completion system uses subsequence matching. This means that you can type just two or three letters from anywhere in the filename to complete the filename. For example, say you want the filename ``../images/arrow1.png``, you can simply type ``ia1`` and press Tab to complete the filename. When searching for matches, the completion system prioritizes letters that are at the start of a word, or immediately after a path separator. Once you get used to this system, you will find it saves you a lot of time and effort."

The editor allows you to insert a snippet with only a few key strokes. The snippets are very powerful, with many features, such as placeholders you can jump between, automatic mirroring of repeated text and so on. For more information, see :doc:`snippets`."
