"As noted above, there are two search and replace modes: character match and "

"the search characters in the field will be replaced. For example, assume the"

"Regular expression mode has some differences from character mode, beyond (of"

"The third and most important is that the replace string can make reference "
"to parts of the search string by using backreferences. A backreference is "
"``\\\\n`` where n is an integer that refers to the n'th parenthesized group "
"in the search expression. For example, given the same example as above, `a "
"bad cat`, a search expression `a (...) (...)`, and a replace expression `a "
"\\\\2 \\\\1`, the result will be `a cat bad`. Please see the "
":ref:`regexptutorial` for more information on backreferences."

"One useful pattern: assume you want to change the case of an entire field. "
"The easiest way to do this is to use character mode, but lets further assume"
" you want to use regular expression mode. The search expression should be "
"`(.*)` the replace expression should be `\\\\1`, and the desired case change"
" function should be selected."

"Finally, in regular expression mode you can copy values from one field to "
"another. Simply make the source and destination field different. The copy "
"can replace the destination field, prepend to the field (add to the front), "
"or append to the field (add at the end). The 'use comma' checkbox tells "
"calibre to (or not to) add a comma between the text and the destination field "
"in prepend and append modes. If the destination is multiple (e.g., tags), "

"Search and replace is done after all the other metadata changes in the other"

"going to happen, do not mix search/replace with other changes."
